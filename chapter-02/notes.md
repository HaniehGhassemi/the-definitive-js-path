# Chapter 01 - Notes

In this chapter, I reviewed fundamental concepts of JavaScriptâ€™s lexical structure, including case sensitivity, whitespace, comments, identifiers, reserved words, and Unicode. Most of these topics were familiar to me from previous studies.

However, the section on Unicode Escape Sequences introduced two distinct ways to write Unicode characters, which was new to me:

- The old form with exactly four hexadecimal digits: `\u00E9`
- The new form introduced in ES6 using curly braces and 1 to 6 hexadecimal digits: `\u{E9}`

The new form supports a wider range of Unicode code points, including emojis.

Learning about this new escape sequence format helped me better understand how JavaScript handles Unicode characters.
