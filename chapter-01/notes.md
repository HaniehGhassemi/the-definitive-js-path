This chapter introduces the **JavaScript language** from a high-level perspective ‚Äî its nature, capabilities, and overall structure.

## üìå What I Learned

### ‚òëÔ∏è JavaScript Characteristics

- **Interpreted**: Executes code line-by-line at runtime.
- **High-level language**:
  - Closer to human language
  - Simple syntax
  - Developers can focus on _what_ to do, not _how_
- **Dynamic typing**:
  - No need to declare types explicitly
  - Types are checked and converted at runtime

> These features make JS ideal for both **object-oriented** and **functional programming** styles.

### ‚òëÔ∏è JavaScript's Roots

JavaScript draws inspiration from:

- **Scheme** ‚Üí first-class functions
- **Self** ‚Üí prototype-based inheritance

---

### ‚òëÔ∏è JavaScript Usage Areas

- **Core JavaScript** is used to work with:
  - Numbers, Strings, Arrays, Sets, Maps, etc.
- **In the browser**:
  - Input via mouse, keyboard, HTTP requests
  - Output via HTML & CSS

### ‚òëÔ∏è Examples for This Chapter

Each chapter contains examples and notes on how to run them.

In this chapter, the topics are straightforward, so there are no notes except for **01-interpreted**, which includes additional notes.

However, **02-high-level** and **03-dynamic-typing** provide simple code samples for better understanding.

To run these examples, I use Node.js:

1. Open the directory containing the example file in your terminal.
2. Run the command:

```bash
node example.js
```
