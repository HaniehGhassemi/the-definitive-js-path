## 📌 What is this repository?

This repository is a hands-on, practical walkthrough of one of the most comprehensive books in JavaScript:  
**_JavaScript: The Definitive Guide_ (7th Edition)**.

It serves as both:

- ✍️ A collection of code exercises based on each chapter
- 📖 A place to write summaries, notes, and insights as I deepen my understanding of core JavaScript

Whether you're reading the book or just looking for real-world JavaScript snippets, this repo could help!

## 🌿 Branching Strategy

Each **chapter of the book** is implemented as a **separate Git branch**.  
This helps keep the exercises modular, focused, and organized.

### 🔀 Structure:

| Branch Name            | Represents           | Description                   |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `chapter-01-values`    | Chapter 1            | Values, Types, and Operators  |
| `chapter-02-functions` | Chapter 2            | Functions                     |
| `chapter-03-objects`   | Chapter 3            | Working with Objects          |
| ...                    | ...                  | ...                           |
| `main`                 | Final merged version | Merged output of all chapters |

> 💡 Each branch has its own `README.md` with a summary of what that chapter covers and any key takeaways.
